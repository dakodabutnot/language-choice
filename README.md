# language-choice
###### Choice language package for Atom.

---

A wiki explaining Choice's structure can be found [here](https://github.com/dakodabutnot/choice), and a work-in-progress Java/ANTLR parser can be found [here](https://github.com/dakodabutnot/java-choice).

### Installation

1. Download **Atom** if you don't already have it.
2. 
    a. On **Windows** go to `File > Settings` and then  `Install` in the menu that appears. Enter in this repo's URL (`https://github.com/dakodabutnot/language-choice`) into the `Search packages` field at the top and hit install.
  
    b. **Installed just the same on OSX**, except the settings are located at `Atom > Preferences...`.
    
3. Reload Atom. On **Windows** this is `Ctrl-Shift-F5`, on **OSX** this is `^⌥⌘L`.

4. To use, open up a `.choice` or a `.tree` file and, if **Atom** hasn't already, select **Choice** as your language at the bottom-right.

_Good luck!_
